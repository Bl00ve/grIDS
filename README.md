My network monitoring solution and tools that go along with it. This setup is designed to be contained in an all-in-one sort of system, but individual services can be set up on separate services with minimal changes.

The goal for this project is to help people combine multiple open-source tools to have a useful network monitoring solution. Feedback, corrections, and suggestions are welcomed and appreciated.

# Configuration Steps
To configure the system, follow the steps found in the [setup.md document](docs/setup.md)
